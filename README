TrinityCore database World of Warcraft 3.3.5 

Looking for developers.

Few things that can have use for devs if anyone knows how to code them:
Add guids, phasemasks to spawns.
Add pools and waypoints.
Add zone maps with quest givers, taxis, etc like wowhead.

Known bugs:

Dropdowns don't works with Spanish locales under ie9.
Talent calculator works only with few classes.
